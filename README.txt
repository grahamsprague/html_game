This project is an attempt to create a clone of Zelda's labrinth gameplay. I did this as an exercide to understand a few key concepts of video game game development. Further I wanted to see if I could acomplish this using a browser, html, css and javascript. I also used jQuery.

Map Design
Character Movement and Animation
Collision and Bounds Detection

if you have npm installed just run this to make sure jquery gets installed.

npm uopdate

Then just open the index.html in a browser.
