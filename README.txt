This project is an attempt to create a clone of Zelda's labrinth gameplay. I did this as an exercide to understand a few key concepts of video game game development. Further I wanted to see if I could acomplish this using a browser, html, css and javascript. I also used jQuery.

Map Design
Character Movement and Animation
Collision and Bounds Detection

To get this running you'll first need to uopdate npm packages.

npm uopdate

Then just open the tile_test.html in a browser.
